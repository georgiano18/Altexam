            <h2>Project Title: Deploying a Basic Web Server on AWS EC2</h2>
            <p><strong>Student ID:</strong> ALT/SOE/024/1224</p>
            <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> 
            This project involves setting up and deploying a basic web server on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance. It explores the fundamentals of cloud computing, server management, and web hosting. The goal is to understand how to configure, secure, and manage a server in the cloud, providing hands-on experience with AWS services including EC2, VPC, and Security Groups. This project not only enhances my technical skills but also provides a practical foundation for web development and cloud architecture.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Oselade George Oluwaseun, and I am deeply passionate about technology, particularly in the realms of cloud computing and software engineering. I hail from Nigeria, where I've immersed myself in the vibrant tech community. My journey into tech began with a curiosity about how software can solve real-world problems, leading me to pursue formal education in Computer Science and further certifications in cloud technologies.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I am an avid reader, with a particular interest in science fiction and biographies of tech pioneers. I also enjoy outdoor sports like football and hiking, which I believe help balance my often sedentary coding lifestyle. My cultural background has taught me the value of community and collaboration, principles I bring to every project I work on.</p>
            <p>I have a knack for problem-solving, often seen participating in hackathons where I've won several accolades for innovative solutions using cloud services. My goal is to contribute to making technology more accessible and efficient, especially in my home country where tech adoption is rapidly increasing. Apart from my professional life, I volunteer time to teach coding basics to underprivileged youths, believing in the power of education as a tool for empowerment.</p>
            <p>I am always eager to learn new technologies, currently exploring the potential of machine learning in cloud environments to enhance server operations and user experience. My dream is to one day lead a team that builds scalable, secure, and impactful tech solutions globally.</p>
